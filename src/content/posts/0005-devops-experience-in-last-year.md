# Time is arguably more valuable than money because you canâ€™t raise more time. 

**I think DevOps is a very suitable job for me** 

The fllowing are the reasons:
In the beginning it combines updating, light coding, fixing, monitoring and so on, 
so it easily catches my attention, if I tire of one kind of work I can just swiftly switch to another.
Lastly it's also very quick to see the outcome, which can stimulate me to keep optimizing it.

## Summary of recent DevOps experience.
**Avoid the unsafe or uncertain operation** 

Such as importing seed data, performing a large query, or executing SQL updates.  

**Keep back up** 

Design the backup strategy in advance.
When doing the large-scale changes to the database, keep the SQL scripts, execution logs, and raw data.

**Respecting customer privacy and the right to infromed** 

Data desensitization and informed cunstomer when deploying monitoring applications.

**Maintain a clean environment** 

Ensure configuration files are under robust version control. (using winmerge)
Prefer adding new configurations over updating or deleting existing ones. (This practice ensures your work is reversible/allow for rollback)
Don't leave your configuration files in the wrong path, as it may lead to a confusing error.

**Handle the exception is the most important thing** 

Finding the solution is as important as identifying the root cause.
The quickest way to solve problems is to identify the key variables/factors.
The solution should be implemented carefully and effectively.
To improve the problem-solving ability, accumulation useful scripts regularly.
